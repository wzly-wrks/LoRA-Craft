Alright, here’s an upgraded prompt that rolls your new features in and explains LoRA Craft *exactly* the way Replit likes to chew on it — clear, structured, and “here’s what to build, no guessing.”

Drop this straight into Replit:

**PROMPT FOR REPLIT / DEV ASSISTANT**

I’m building an app called **LoRA Craft**.
LoRA Craft is an end-to-end dataset builder designed for training LoRA image models (Flux, SDXL, etc.). Your job is to help me architect, refine, and code the entire application.

Here’s what LoRA Craft does:

**1. Image Collection & Search**
• Users can search for images directly inside the app (Google/Bing/Brave API or similar).
• Users can import/upload their own images.
• The app stores them into a “collection workspace” where users can sort, tag, and clean their dataset.

**2. Dataset Cleaning & Prep**
• Auto-crop subject and/or face.
• Remove duplicates.
• Enforce ideal aspect ratios.
• Auto-caption (BLIP, LLaVA, or other captioning models).
• Manual editing of captions and tags.
• Enforce recommended dataset sizes.
• Export image metadata in the right structure.

**3. Integration with Replicate.com**
• Users can push the finalized dataset directly to Replicate for LoRA training.
• The app packages images + captions + config into a JSON payload Replicate accepts.
• Show training progress and return download URLs for model outputs.

**4. Dataset Export**
• Users can export the prepared dataset as a ZIP (images + captions + metadata).
• Folder structure follows industry-standard LoRA training conventions.

**5. UX Philosophy**
LoRA Craft should feel like “dataset creation for humans.”
Clean UI, drag-and-drop, simple workflows, idiot-proof guardrails, and every step visually tells the user what's happening.

**What I want from you:**
• Clean, production-quality code (not pseudocode).
• Architecture guidance.
• Suggestions for libraries, image-processing tools, and APIs.
• UI/UX layout ideas.
• Full modules/components when needed.
• No vague answers — give complete implementations.

Build everything assuming the whole purpose is to make dataset creation stupidly easy, even for people who don’t understand machine learning.

If you want, I can also give you a **variant optimized for Python**, **Tauri/React**, **Electron**, or even a **backend-first version**.
